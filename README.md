# Joyton
This is an experimental library to hash out an idea for rebindable semantic input in Roblox.

There's nothing useful here yet.

Core ideas:

* **Declarative**: Bindings are defined up-front, making nice UI easy.
* **Centralized**: Bindings are defined in one place, making holistic reasoning possible.
* **Contextual**: *Contexts* are defined instead of using priorities, akin to VS Code's key binding system.

Bonus ideas:

* **Versioned**: As new bindings are added to a game, the user's existing custom bindings should gracefully upgrade.
